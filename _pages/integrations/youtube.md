      <h3>✅ Long Form Interviews and Discussions</h3>
      <p>
        Great insights and broad picture thinking presented in its entirety. In-depth, hour long discussions are generally
better than 30-second clips to add the necessary context and present assumptions. But be weary of any interview that does not
present both sides, remember Bob Farrell's Rule #9: <span class="fst-italic">When all the experts and forecasts agree-something 
else is going to happen.</span> One-sided thinking is usually more harmful than it is helpful.

      <h3>❌ Charisma and Sales-pitches</h3>
      <p>
        A great suit, large smile and projection of confidence is a time-tested method to sell ideas. Remember that guests
do appearances to attract clients, and this shapes what they are willing to say.

      <h3>❌ Complicit Hosts and Programming Agendas</h3>
      <p>
        The presence of a neutral host psychologically provides legitimacy balancing out the implied bias of guests. But this is an illusion
and today's popular shows and networks are funded by sponsors, advertisers or clickbait engagement practices. It is also popular for
guests to pay to appear on channels with large number of viewers as a form of PR for their services.
